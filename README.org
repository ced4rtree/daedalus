* My NixOS Configuration

[[./images/screenshot.png]]

To test my dots on a NixOS system, you can just run ~nix run github:ced4rtree/dotfiles~.

** Structure
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
dotfiles
├── flake.nix # Root file declaring my configuration
├── flake.lock # lock file keeping track of the versions used for my inputs
├── system # directory for global system configuration settings
│   ├── default.nix # imports the other two dirs and declares some other miscellaneous settings
│   ├── core # things that are required for or happen during the bootup sequence
│   └── userspace # things that the user directly interfaces with
└── user # directory for my Home Manager config
    ├── default.nix # imports the other directories here & declares desired packages
    ├── bar      # configuration for whatever bar I feel like using
    ├── editor   # configuration for any editors I want to use
    ├── files    # direct file installations (e.g. wallpaper)
    ├── launcher # configuration for whatever launcher I feel like using
    ├── programs # configuration for miscellaneous programs, e.g. qutebrowser, etc.
    ├── shell    # configuration for whatever shell I feel like using
    ├── terminal # configuration for whatever terminal I feel like using
    └── wm       # configuration for whatever window manager I feel like using

** Normal Dotfiles Where?
For anybody who doesn't know how to (or want to) read or use nix, a copy of my
old dotfiles in standard form are kept under the ~.archive~ folder, so anybody
who wants to learn from them still can.

Keep in mind, there are still some programs I use whose source files are in
their standard format, and the nix configuration just uses those. The biggest
example is emacs, which has both its [[file:user/emacs/config.org][literate configuration file]] and [[file:user/emacs/init.el][resulting
emacs lisp configuration file]] available in plain text.
