* My NixOS Configuration

Right now, to install my dots, you can just run ~nix run github:ced4rtree/dotfiles~.

** Structure
 - ~flake.nix~: The root declaration of my config. Pretty boring tbh
 - ~flake.lock~: Lock file keeping track of what versions I have installed for my package inputs
 - ~user/~: This directory contains all of my Home Manager settings, and declares the configurations for all of the apps I interact with frequently (emacs, hyprland, etc.)
 - ~system/~: This directory defines how the global nix configuration should be setup, e.g. grub settings, networking, etc.
 - ~files/~: A directory containing specific files I want to be installed, like my wallpaper.
   
** Normal Dotfiles Where?
For anybody who doesn't know how to (or want to) read or use nix, a copy of my
old dotfiles in standard form are kept under the ~.archive~ folder, so anybody
who wants to learn from them still can.

Keep in mind, there are still some programs I use whose source files are in
their standard format, and the nix configuration just uses those. The biggest
example is emacs, which has both its [[file:user/emacs/config.org][literate configuration file]] and [[file:user/emacs/init.el][resulting
emacs lisp configuration file]] available in plain text.
