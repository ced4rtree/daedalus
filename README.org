* My NixOS Configuration

Daedalus was a wise, skilled craftsman in Greek mythology, much like how I like
to think of my dotfiles (though admittedly, they're likely not quite as sharp).

** Flake-parts

This configuration is an example of the
[[dendritic][https://dendrix.oeiuwq.com/]] pattern in nix. Every file is loaded,
and every file defines a module. The file structure is explained more
thoroughly below.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
daedalus
├── flake.nix # the root flake used to define system outputs
└── modules
    ├── configuration.nix # the primary file that defines the system and home configs
    ├── desktop # definitions for various desktop programs. Window managers, terminals, etc.
    ├── hosts   # extra configurations for specific hosts. Define filesystems, hardware imports
    ├── presets # bundles of presets to use for different computer use cases
    └── system  # definitions for various system level programs, like the bootloader and audio
#+END_EXAMPLE
   
** Normal Dotfiles Where?
For anybody who doesn't know how to (or want to) read or use nix, a copy of my
old dotfiles in standard form are kept under the ~archive~ branch, so anybody
who wants to learn from them still can.

Keep in mind, there are still some programs I use whose source files are in
their standard format, and the nix configuration just uses those. The biggest
example is emacs, which has both its [[file:user/editor/emacs/config.org][literate configuration file]] and
[[file:user/editor/init.el][resulting emacs lisp configuration file]] available
in plain text.
